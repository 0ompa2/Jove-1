# Lex and Yacc

lex.py and yacc.py originate from David Beazley's PLY tool (see
http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/). I may not have the latest pair of
these files, but what I obtained seems to work fine.

# PCP Solver

Ling Zhao's PCP Solver is required in Drive_pcp.ipynb lives (which
is Jove/notebooks/driver). The PCP solver is obtainable from
https://github.com/chrozz/PCPSolver.git and you are requested to
clone it somewhere, build it, and move the executable, namely "pcp",
to the directory where Drive_pcp.ipynb lives.
