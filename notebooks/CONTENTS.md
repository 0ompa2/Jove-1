* driver: This contains many "drivers" for driving the Jove functionality.
  Thus, you will find Drive_DFA.ipynb inside driver/. It helps drive the
  contents of Def_DFA.ipynb inside src/. This cleanly separates out the
  basic definitions pertaining to DFA (contained inside Def_..) from how
  a user might use it (contained inside Drive_...)

* module: This is a "mixed-up" collection of ipynb files. Continuing with
  our example above, Module3_DFA.ipynb contains some definitions from
  Def_DFA.ipynb followed by some commands to drive (similar to those in
  Drive_DFA.ipynb).

* src: These are the .ipynb notebooks that help generate .py files for
  inclusion in various other notebooks.

* tutorial: These are various single-topic tutorials (often containing
  Youtube videos) on how to use Jove. These may pertain to lectures I've
  given on specific days, and illustrates what a class-room activity
  using Jove might consist of.
