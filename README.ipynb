    "This git project presents the Jupyter notebooks that go with\n",
    "Ganesh Gopalakrishnan's book \n",
    "\n",
    " _Automata and Computability: Programmer's Perspective_\n",
    "\n",
    "We may abbreviate this book's title by ``ACPP''\n",
    " \n",
    "The code collection is called \"Jove\" (which the reader may\n",
    "recognize as another name for planet Jupiter). We will refer\n",
    "to the software offering as a whole as \"Jove notebooks\" but\n",
    "sometimes also as Jupyter notebooks (when referring to the\n",
    "individual notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jove is a collection of Jupyter notebooks illustrating many\n",
    "principles:\n",
    "* Sets, strings and languages\n",
    "* Language operations\n",
    "* Construction of and operations on DFA and NFA\n",
    "* Regular expression parsing and automata inter-conversion\n",
    "* Derivate-based parsing\n",
    "* Pushdown automata\n",
    "* The construction of parsers using context-free productions\n",
    "* Studies of parsing: ambiguity, associativity, precedence\n",
    "* Turing machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Jupyter notebooks start with a Youtube video link\n",
    "describing the notebook's content and operation. This can serve\n",
    "as a handy ``self-tutorial'' of the notebook. Even without such\n",
    "a video, all notebooks are documented to some extent as are the\n",
    "functions introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This README also contains a mini\n",
    "[Jove Reference Manual](#jove-reference-manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jove's Design and Code Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Jove's structure is kept deliberately simple to cater to a broad\n",
    "audience. We do not employ classes or objects. All automata are\n",
    "simple structs. A functional style of programming is preferred\n",
    "where each function takes an automaton-struct and returns another.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often prefer a side-effect-free functional/recursive/higher-order\n",
    "style of coding to make the logic of the function stand out.\n",
    "When iteration makes sense (e.g. NFA to RE conversion) we do employ\n",
    "the more familiar iterative style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most automata (NFA, DFA, PDA, and Turing machines) have \"Def_...\"\n",
    "files that define basic operations on these machine-types. We then\n",
    "provide \"Drive_...\" files that drive these definitions to illustrate\n",
    "the use of the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to include the \"Def_...\" files into the \"Drive_...\" files,\n",
    "we prefer to generate Python [.py] files from the former, store these\n",
    "files into an Imports/ directory, and include those [.py] files into\n",
    "the \"Drive_...\" files. While the direct importing of Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "into other notebooks is supported, we once ran into bugs, and felt\n",
    "that this arrangement was more foolproof.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key requirement is to have **lex.py** and **yacc.py** in the top-level\n",
    "directory. This will be invoked during parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All automata are displayed using Graphiviz for which your Jupyter\n",
    "notebook must have Graphiviz installed.\n",
