    "\n",
    "Humans cannot exist in this intellectual society without having the means for unambiguous communication. Unless they can use symbols to write down things and have full confidence that another human or computer will understand it exactly as intended, things can go horribly wrong. For example, if we write down an expression of the form 3 \\* 4 + 5 \\* 6, something tells us that it was intended to communicate 42 (i.e. (3\\*4)+(5\\*6)) and not 360 (if we calculate it as 3\\*(4+5)\\*6). Yet, such obvious precedence rules (that \\* carries more precedence than +) that are known by elementary school children are not \"known\" to a computer. We must explicitly instruct computer front-end parsers to calculate such expressions obeying the right precedences. Yet, the discovery of operator-precedence parsing wasn't easy. Early compilers had extremely hairy rules for parsing even such expressions.  They for instance replaced '+' by \")))+(((\", '*' by \"))*((\", etc. The resulting complexity and impenetrability of early compilers is covered in a historic paper entitled \"History of writing compilers\" by [Knuth][KnuthCompilerHistory].  \n",
    "\n",
    "The design of modern formal languages -- whether they be programming languages, scripting languages or even regular-expression specification languages -- is really a marvel of human ingenuity. This point comes up again in [Padua's LCPC 2014 conference keynote][padualcpc] where it is made clear how Fortran compilers dealt with expressions such as (2 \\* (3 + 4) - (8 - 7)) in entirely ad-hoc ways, as they did not have a formal understanding of operator precedence and context-free parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if reliable parsing is available, it must be guaranteed that just forgetting a \",\" (comma) somewhere must not result in a legal program with an entirely different meaning; yet, historically this has happened!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lost Comma results in Lost Spacecraft \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of an early computer languaged -- notably Fortran -- proved too brittle, not lending itself to easy error correction. Here is an eye-opening story, supposedly from Mariner-1 (although there is some controversy on whether this story is entirely true -- see [Wikipedia on Mariner][mariner] -- it is a good story!). Apparently this spacecraft was lost because someone forgot to type a comma!  How so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here was the intended loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The loop that faulted was intended to be something like\n",
    "> \n",

    "\n",
    "> ...loop body...\n",
    "\n",
    "> 10 CONTINUE\n",
    "\n",
    "However, someone did not type a comma after the I = 1 and the code looked like this:\n",

    "> DO 10 I = 1 100\n",
    "\n",
    "> 10 CONTINUE\n",

    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., a fresh variable DO10I gets assigned 1100. Then the loop body executes once. Finally, the \"10 CONTINUE\" serves as a no op. The result is that the loop body is executed exact once, and not 100 times as was intended!!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Please do not \"Wing\" Scanners and Parsers\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of writing reliable (correct) scanners and parsers arises in a number of other contexts besides parsing programs. A Unix command of the form 'rm file\\[0-1\\]\\[0-1\\]\\[0-1\\]\\*' must remove files ending in two or more occurrences of \\[0-1\\], and not remove a file named file0; recognizing this needs a regular-expression parser (otherwise known as a *scanner*). Another practical example of regular language parsing is in [deep packet inspection systems][deeppkt] that help filter out spam traveling at high speeds (e.g., 10 Gbps). In this case, scanning must be correct *and* extremely fast. Writing fast scanners is still a hot research topic as evidenced by recent papers in prestigious conferences (e.g., by [Mytkowicz et al.][MadanParallelFSM]). The Micron company sells chips implementing fast scanning, in the form of the [Micron Automaton Processor!][MicronAutomatonProcessor].\n",
    "\n",
    "All these stories tell us that significant progress was achieved in the 20th centry (around the 1960s) in terms of  theories of Regular Languages and Context-Free Languages. These theories underlie our ability to *unambiguously parse* sentences belonging to *formal languages*. These developments form centerpieces of this course where, thanks to these innovations, we can teach these topics in a nice and convenient way using Jupyter notebooks to today's undergraduates!\n",
