# Introduction

  These notes pertain to using Jove on Google's 'colab' facility.
  It helps anyone use Jove without installing Jupyter notebooks!
  
  These runs are done by referring to Jove's github but the colab branch.
  Please point to the colab branch (the other branches won't work).
  
  Here is how you get started:

  1. Make a folder "My Drive/CS3100Spring20", or your chosen name.
  
  2. cd to CS3100Spring20, and
  
  3. git clone https://github.com/ganeshutah/Jove.git in here

  4. Then proceed with browsing
    http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master
    
    and give the Github path https://github.com/ganeshutah/Jove.git

    and do switch to the colab branch

  5. Begin working with any of the notebooks you see in here.

  6. You can see the Jupyter sessions in vogue, stop any session (especially
     if you exceed the number of sessions), etc.

  7. You may also browse files on Github and run them in the colab mode

Further notes on colab will be provided in due course.
